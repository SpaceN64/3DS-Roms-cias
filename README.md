# 3DS-Roms-cias
This is a rip of my 3DS roms, that are in the file format ".cia".

# Downloading onto your 3DS

To download this onto your 3DS, your 3DS has to be on cfw, and have the homebrew application "FBI" downloaded.

A tutorial on which how to get your 3DS running cfw is linked here:
https://3ds.hacks.guide

DO NOT USE A YOUTUBE TUTORIAL - those tend to be out of date, and have a higher chance of bricking your system entirely. Do this at your own caution as i am not responsible for bricked 3DS'.

# Compatability
.cia - For use on a actual 3DS

.3ds - Reserved for 3DS Emulators (Citra, etc)

# When will you upload more?
More will be added when i have time to actually rip them lol
